# Puma-Sales-Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow using Python (Pandas), SQL, and Power BI.
The raw Puma sales dataset was first cleaned and preprocessed in Pandas by handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing invalid records.
After data cleaning, structured SQL queries were written to perform filtering, aggregation, and business analysis such as total sales, top-performing products, and city-wise performance.
Finally, the processed data was connected to Power BI to create an interactive dashboard with key KPIs, charts, and insights that help understand sales trends and customer behavior.
